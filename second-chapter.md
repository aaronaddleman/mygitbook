# Second Chapter

I wonder how you have sub chapters. Are they based on the headers?

## This is Heading 2 of Second Chapter

I wonder where this will end up...

[First Chapter](/chapter1.md "oh this is nice")

Ok this is really nice when I want to insert a link, it scans the content for linkable items \(headings\)

# Ok, this is v1 branch

I imagine this is just a git branch that I can merge later on.

# Very nice

There is a conflict resolver with dual panes to compare changes. This text has been added while diong the comparison, while the text above was added in from v1 and the text below was added on to master after the branch cut. Very nice.

# Oh cool

I can switch really easily between active branches. I wonder how it handles conflicts?
