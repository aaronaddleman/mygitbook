# Second Chapter

I wonder how you have sub chapters. Are they based on the headers?

## This is Heading 2 of Second Chapter

I wonder where this will end up...

[First Chapter](/chapter1.md "oh this is nice")

Ok this is really nice when I want to insert a link, it scans the content for linkable items \(headings\)

# Oh cool

I can switch really easily between active branches. I wonder how it handles conflicts?
